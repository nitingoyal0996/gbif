OCCURRENCE_PARAMETER_GUIDELINES = """
You must respect the occurrence parameters model.

Other parameters:
- limit: Use when the request specifies a number of results to return (default 20, max 100)
- offset: Use for pagination when the request mentions "more results" or "next page"
- q: Use for full-text search when the request is vague and none of the other specific parameters are available
"""

SPECIES_PARAMETER_GUIDELINES = """
If the thing/species in request is not specific, use appropriate species GBIF API filter keys to narrow the search down, keep `q` as your last resort.
"""

SPECIES_TAXONOMIC_PARAMETER_GUIDELINES = """
For taxonomic information requests, focus on extracting the species usage key (taxon key) which is REQUIRED.
The usageKey is a unique integer identifier for a species in the GBIF backbone.

Key parsing rules:
- ALWAYS extract the usageKey (taxon key) from the request - this is mandatory
- Look for specific species IDs, taxon keys, or usage keys mentioned in the request
- If the request mentions a species by name but doesn't provide a usage key, you may need to ask for clarification
- The usageKey should be an integer (e.g., 5231190, 2476674, 2877951)

IMPORTANT: Only set optional boolean parameters to True if they are EXPLICITLY mentioned in the request:

- includeSynonyms: Set to True ONLY if the request explicitly mentions synonyms, alternative names, or taxonomic alternatives
- includeChildren: Set to True ONLY if the request explicitly mentions child taxa, subspecies, varieties, lower taxonomic levels, or "children"
- includeParents: Set to True ONLY if the request explicitly mentions parent taxa, higher taxonomic levels, or "parents"

SPECIAL CASES:
- If the request mentions "hierarchy", "taxonomic hierarchy", or "classification", this typically means BOTH parents AND children, so set both includeParents=True AND includeChildren=True
- If the request mentions "complete taxonomic information" or "all taxonomic data", consider including synonyms as well

Default behavior: If a parameter is not explicitly mentioned, set it to False to avoid unnecessary API calls.

Other optional parameters:
- limit: Use when the request specifies a number of results to return (default 20, max 100)
- offset: Use for pagination when the request mentions "more results" or "next page"

Important: If the request mentions a species by name but doesn't provide a usage key, respond and ask for clarification.

Examples:
- "Retrieve children species of taxon-id 2476674" → includeChildren=True, includeSynonyms=False, includeParents=False
- "Get taxonomic information for species 5231190" → includeChildren=False, includeSynonyms=False, includeParents=False (basic info only)
- "Show taxonomic hierarchy and synonyms for species 2877951" → includeParents=True, includeChildren=True, includeSynonyms=True
- "Show me the taxonomic hierarchy for Quercus robur" → includeParents=True, includeChildren=True, includeSynonyms=False
"""

REGISTRY_PARAMETER_GUIDELINES = """
Infer search parameters for the GBIF Registry dataset search API from the user's request. Users can search with author, title, description, etc. and many more things, look out for these keywords.

Guidelines:
- Only set parameters that are explicitly mentioned or clearly implied by the user's request.
- Do not invent or guess parameter values.
- If a parameter is not mentioned or implied, leave it unset.
- Use faceting parameters only if the user asks for breakdowns, analysis, or summaries.
- Use pagination parameters only if the user requests a specific number of results or mentions pagination.
- If the request is ambiguous, prefer not to set extra parameters.

Examples:
- "Find datasets about birds" → q="birds"
- "Show me checklist datasets from the US" → type=CHECKLIST, publishingCountry="US"
- "Recent datasets" → modifiedDate="2020,*"
- "Datasets with more than 1000 records" → recordCount="1000,*"
- "Datasets from Europe with CC-BY license" → continent="EUROPE", license="CC-BY"

Refer to the Pydantic model for parameter details and descriptions.
"""

FIELD_NUANCES = """

GBIF FIELD NUANCES: 
Below are some observations based on real world usage that you must consider when parsing the request:

- use recordNumber for the collector’s field number and recordedBy/recordedByID for the collector identity
- If there is a specific location given, use convert that into latitude and longitude coordinates.
- Do not add taxonomic keys such as - kingdomKey, phylumKey, classKey, orderKey, familyKey, genusKey, speciesKey, etc. unless they are explicitly mentioned in the request or to narrow down the search if the request does not contain a scientific information
- Be extra careful with the range fields and queries, follow the pydantic model format. For example, when user asks what happened between 1890 and 1892, the year field should be 1890,1892 not 1890,1891,1892. The schema will provide more details.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """

Today's date = {CURRENT_DATE}

You are an AI assistant who helps to parse the request into the correct parameters for the GBIF API. You do not know anything except what is in this prompt. You must not add any information yourself that was not provided in the user request. You must respect the "parameters" needs. and parse all possible parameters from the user request.

You ask for clarification if you cannot decide the API parameters from the user request. If the object that the user is asking for in request is not clear, ask for clarification.

{FIELD_NUANCES}

Make sure the time range queries are correctly formatted, strictly follow the pydantic model format. For count the records queries, make sure you pick the right facet keys. Be aware of multiple parameter values in the user request, return a list of values for the parameter.
